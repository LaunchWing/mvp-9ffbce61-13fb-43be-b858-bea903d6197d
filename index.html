Here's what we found:\n\nWhen evaluating the viability of an AI resume template generator startup, consider the following aspects:\n\n### Market\n- **Size &amp; Growth**: The resume writing and career services market is substantial, encompassing job seekers globally. With the increasing adoption of AI in HR and recruitment, tools that streamline and enhance the resume creation process are in demand.\n- **Trends**: There is a growing trend towards personalization and optimization of resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).
